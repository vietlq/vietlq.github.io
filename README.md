During a live stream, you can embed live chat on your own side by using an iframe.

Get the video ID for the live stream. You can get the video ID from the watch page URL (youtube.com/watch?v=12345). In this case, the video ID is ‘12345’.

If you chose "Stream now," right-click on the player and select Copy video URL to get the video URL.

Get the domain URL for the site you want to embed chat on. If you're embedding chat on www.example.com/youtube_chat, your embedding domain is "www.example.com."

Combine the embedded URL in the following way: https://www.youtube.com/live_chat?v=12345&embed_domain=www.example.com.

This is the URL for your iframe. Note the embed_domain must match the the URL of the page you’re embedding the chat on. If they are different, the embedded chat will not load.
