      <description>Nowadays getting HTTPS is no longer expensive. GitHub provides free HTTPS for your GitHub pages and you can choose to enable in the Settings for each of your repository:
The benefits of this is multi-fold:
 Better security for your readers Better SEO for your pages Styles will not degrade because when loading from HTTPS, no insecure HTTP styles and scripts are allowed. You can however load scripts and styles served via HTTPS on your HTTP pages  If you are using a blogging engine like Hugo, remember to change our baseURL to HTTPS or your readers will moan and groan about ugly face of your page without make ups from CSS &amp;amp; Javascript:</description>
