      <description>Yesterday I spent a couple of hours to set up and config Octopress. It was a good hacking experience and Octopress architecture and design proved overly complex and inconsistent with Jekyll&amp;rsquo;s simplicity that it built on. There&amp;rsquo;s no simple way to use a Jekyll theme with Octopress. Apart from that, Octopress has not been in good health since 2015, there were few commits and changes, it&amp;rsquo;s literally dying. So today I decided to make a bold move to search for new static site generators.</description>

      <description>The Story I have been looking for ways to make static blogging possible. The danger of having WordPress and its insecure plugins is a no-no for me. A couple of years ago I came across Jekyll and the amount of Ruby dependencies and steps to accomplish a single task was disturbing and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a pleasant start. So I sticked with WordPress while still looking for alternatives.
Octopress appeared in searches and I gave it a try.</description>
