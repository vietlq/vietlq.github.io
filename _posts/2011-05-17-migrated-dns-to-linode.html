<p>Previously I hosted all DNS records for <strong>simpleit.us<&#47;strong> with <strong>NearlyFreeSpeech<&#47;strong> (<a title="Nearly Free Speech Hosting" href="https:&#47;&#47;www.nearlyfreespeech.net&#47;">https:&#47;&#47;www.nearlyfreespeech.net&#47;<&#47;a>). They provide cheap DNS hosting at 1c&#47;day per zone. Initially I didn't hosted my DNS records with Linode as I was interested in redundancy. However, later I realized that I didn't have any back-up&#47;disaster recovery site on par with the VPS hosted with Linode. The&nbsp; account I have with NearlyFreeSpeech is meant for low performance and HTML-only content did not match with my VPS. Thus having DNS hosting with NFS didn't give any extra advantage and I migrated to Linode to centralize my control.</p>
<p>Unlike NFS which gave me freedom to add any kind of records, the Linode DNS manager has the most basic records (SOA, NS, A&#47;AAAA, MX, CNAME, TXT and SRV). That would suffice for any daily needs. I had experience with NFS and Zonomi (DNS host provider). They both require technical details such as the trailing dot "." at the end of each alias&#47;MX mail server. Linode, however, simplified this and caused little confusion. Linode also does not give as much freedom on cache time like NFS or Zonomi do.</p>
<p>Linode was good at hiding technical details for simplicity and I got all SOA, NS and A&#47;AAAA records populated. That saved me lots of typing effort and time as well. I was able to get my domain and subdomains back to running status within 15 minutes. The only issue I had is all emails I sent to @simpleit.us were rejected with 554 error. I have Google Apps hosted on my <strong>simpleit.us<&#47;strong> and enjoyed using emails like abc@simpleit.us. Linode had MX records interface what were little confusing. I had to read their manual <a title="Using Google Apps for Email" href="http:&#47;&#47;library.linode.com&#47;email&#47;google-mail">http:&#47;&#47;library.linode.com&#47;email&#47;google-mail<&#47;a> to fix the issue of email rejection. I went little further by adding the SPF record as advised by Google manual: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;support&#47;a&#47;bin&#47;answer.py?answer=33786">http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;support&#47;a&#47;bin&#47;answer.py?answer=33786<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>There were handy tools that helped me verify my MX records, you may find them useful too:</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.dnsstuff.com&#47;tools&#47;legacy&#47;?formaction=DNSLOOKUP&amp;ToolFormName=customlookup&amp;name=simpleit.us&amp;r=235660&amp;detail=0&amp;type=MX">http:&#47;&#47;www.dnsstuff.com&#47;tools&#47;legacy&#47;?formaction=DNSLOOKUP&amp;ToolFormName=customlookup&amp;name=simpleit.us&amp;r=235660&amp;detail=0&amp;type=MX<&#47;a></p>

<p>If you need to read extra on MX records, refer to Google help: <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;support&#47;a&#47;bin&#47;answer.py?answer=174125">https:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;support&#47;a&#47;bin&#47;answer.py?answer=174125<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Overall, Linode provides good service and I've been using Linode VPS since Feb 2010. Free DNS with many record types is a good deal.
