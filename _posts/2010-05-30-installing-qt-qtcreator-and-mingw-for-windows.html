<p>Ever thought of developing simple &amp; nice cross-platform applications without sweating? Nokia Qt C++ frameworks empowers you to do so. To get started, first install the Qt SDK with IDE and of course famous GNU compiler chain GCC, branded under MinGW for Windows.</p>
<p>Get the framework, IDE &amp; tool chain from: <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-windows-cpp">http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-windows-cpp</a></p>
<p>If you are interested in particular parts of MinGW, look here: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/</a></p>
<p>Just follow default steps and you are safe. If you are interested in free M$ C/C++ compiler, just download the Qt source and build it yourself.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to play with magic. To appreciate Qt, run QtDemo and also watch some clips &amp; read some stuff:</p>
