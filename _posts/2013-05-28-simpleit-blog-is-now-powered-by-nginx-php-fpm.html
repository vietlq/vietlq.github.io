  content: "I usually do not leave a comment, but I looked at a few of the \r\nresponses
    on this page SimpleIT Blog is Now Powered by NginX &amp; PHP FPM.\r\nI actually
    do have a couple of questions for you if it's allright.\r\nCould it be just me
    or does it appear like a few of these responses look as if they are left by brain
    dead individuals?\r\n:-P And, if you are posting at other social \r\nsites, I'd
    like to keep up with you. Would you make a \r\nlist of the complete urls of all
    your social sites like your Facebook page, twitter feed, \r\nor linkedin profile?

<p>After much consideration, I finally moved away from Apache &amp; mod_php to NginX &amp; PHP FPM. The site works much faster and no more I&#47;O &amp; CPU issues. I suspect my Apache was hacked last time, resulting in weird I&#47;O behaviour and spikes in CPU usage.</p>
<p>The next steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install uWSGI for Python and Ruby<&#47;li>
<li>Run NodeJS behind NginX proxy<&#47;li>
<li>Enable WebSockets for NginX &amp; NodeJS<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
