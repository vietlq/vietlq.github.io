<p>I was seeking a code highlighter. I found some great ones but those are not compatible with WP 2.9.2. Users always must make trade off: Security + Usability of the blog engine back-end (either to upgrade) or usability of the front-end and compatibility with old plug-ins &amp; themes (keep the old version). Since it's my fresh install, I'd prefer to go for the latest WP 2.9.2 and I was happy with it's back-end. The tricky part comes when I want to add code highlighting. The highlighters on the top of this page make me drool: <a title="http://speckyboy.com/2009/02/19/12-wordpress-plugins-to-display-and-highlight-code-within-your-blog/" href="http://speckyboy.com/2009/02/19/12-wordpress-plugins-to-display-and-highlight-code-within-your-blog/">http://speckyboy.com/2009/02/19/12-wordpress-plugins-to-display-and-highlight-code-within-your-blog/</a>. Unfortunately they are not compatible. I searched around and found a quite decent one: <a title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codecolorer/" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codecolorer/">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codecolorer/</a>. Let's test it here:</p>
<p>{% highlight php %}
phpinfo();
{% endhighlight %}</p>

<p>{% highlight php %}
class PriceFetcher()
{
    function __construct()
    {
    }

    function __destruct()
    {
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}</p>
<p>Yes, I know, space is being eaten and without spaces, the code looks quite boring. Trying other alternatives for now. This one is simple but not yet perfect.</p>
