<p>I was seeking a code highlighter. I found some great ones but those are not compatible with WP 2.9.2. Users always must make trade off: Security + Usability of the blog engine back-end (either to upgrade) or usability of the front-end and compatibility with old plug-ins &amp; themes (keep the old version). Since it's my fresh install, I'd prefer to go for the latest WP 2.9.2 and I was happy with it's back-end. The tricky part comes when I want to add code highlighting. The highlighters on the top of this page make me drool: <a title="http:&#47;&#47;speckyboy.com&#47;2009&#47;02&#47;19&#47;12-wordpress-plugins-to-display-and-highlight-code-within-your-blog&#47;" href="http:&#47;&#47;speckyboy.com&#47;2009&#47;02&#47;19&#47;12-wordpress-plugins-to-display-and-highlight-code-within-your-blog&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;speckyboy.com&#47;2009&#47;02&#47;19&#47;12-wordpress-plugins-to-display-and-highlight-code-within-your-blog&#47;<&#47;a>. Unfortunately they are not compatible. I searched around and found a quite decent one: <a title="http:&#47;&#47;wordpress.org&#47;extend&#47;plugins&#47;codecolorer&#47;" href="http:&#47;&#47;wordpress.org&#47;extend&#47;plugins&#47;codecolorer&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;wordpress.org&#47;extend&#47;plugins&#47;codecolorer&#47;<&#47;a>. Let's test it here:</p>
<p>[cc lang="php"]<br />
phpinfo();<br />
[&#47;cc]</p>
<p>[cc lang="php"]<br />
class PriceFetcher()<br />
{<br />
function __construct()<br />
{<br />
}</p>
<p>function __destruct()<br />
{<br />
}<br />
}<br />
[&#47;cc]</p>
<p>Yes, I know, space is being eaten and without spaces, the code looks quite boring. Trying other alternatives for now. This one is simple but not yet perfect.</p>
