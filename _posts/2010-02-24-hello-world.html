<p>For customizable &amp; self-hosted blogging, WordPress is one of the best engines. So I'm coming back to WordPress. Must say that WP 2.9.2 is great improvement since 2.5 that I used 2 years ago. Installing Themese and Plug-ins was never as simple as now. Dashboard rocks, and tastes much better than the front-end default theme! After seeking around themes, I chose "Vermillon" by <a title="http:&#47;&#47;www.my-tapestry.com&#47;" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.my-tapestry.com&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;www.my-tapestry.com&#47;<&#47;a>. Caching is enabled via WP-Cache. Seeking plug-ins for code highlight.</p>
