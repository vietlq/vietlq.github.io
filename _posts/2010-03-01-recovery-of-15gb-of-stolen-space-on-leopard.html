<p>I've noticed that my Leopard partition suddenly got fat and GBs were gone somewhere. I decided to find out truth and hope for the way to get back that free space. I checked every single folder under the &#47;. System folders were OK (access to them needs root permissions so clearly no one could dump garbage there). One important folder was suspicious, that was Users. I smelled that my home folder was that fat guy. It turned out right. Diving deeper into each sub-directory of my home folder, I found ~&#47;Library extremely interesting: 15GB+. I was shocked how much garbage was collected in a few days time. It turned out that the Apple Mail was culprit. I downloaded everything it could from my GMail account. It weighed more than 14GB. I deleted that GMail account from Mail and then removed all related folders of that mail account inside ~&#47;Library&#47;Mail. Further, I found that Copernicus (a lousy screen recorder that I removed days before) has collected almost 700MB inside ~&#47;Library&#47;Application Support&#47;Copernicus. I removed it with zero mercy and happy to see more than 15GB came back to me.</p>
