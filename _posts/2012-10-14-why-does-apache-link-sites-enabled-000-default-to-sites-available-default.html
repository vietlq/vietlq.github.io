<p>I was cleaning up Apache config and removed the default 000-default &amp; default-ssl from the Apache sites-enabled sub-folder. To my surprise the default page now goes to a web app that I did not expect. It took me a sec to realize 2 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first VirtualHost config that has format *:80 (HTTP) or *:443 (HTTPS) was considered the default site</li>
<li>Apache loaded files in alphabetical order</li><br />
</ol><br />
So I prepended my blog config file with 000- and now blog is the default site across simpleit.us</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This site is now <a title="SimpleIT Blog is Now Powered by NginX &amp; PHP FPM" href="{% post_url 2013-05-28-simpleit-blog-is-now-powered-by-nginx-php-fpm %}">powered by NginX</a></p>
