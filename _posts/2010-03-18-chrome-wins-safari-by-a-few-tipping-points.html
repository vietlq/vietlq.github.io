<div class="posterous_autopost">A winner app does not need a mind blowing or much superior feature or difference. Many times, a small bit of improvement can make a huge difference in user satisfaction and perception. Seeing Safari or Firefox designs, I perceive them as "heavy" and "slow". Their design filled with dark colors and appear to be very "thick". Chrome, conversely, delivers lightweight look and feel through its design. Lightweight appearance of Chrome makes me feel more pleasing and feel it much faster than Safari and Firefox. Opera design is even worse. </p>
<p>Not only is Chrome more lightweight in design but also outperforms other GUI browsers. But that's a huge topic. I just focus on little bits that make users more satisfied and better informed. I tried uploading files to IVLE <a href="https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/">https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/</a> countless number of times using Safari and it stalls on medium and big uploads (300KB and more). It sit clueless and impatience takes over me when I have to upload submission over 9MB. There are no indication of speed, progress or even a single notice like "loading" or "uploading". Firefox does not do much better. Chrome is different. It keeps me informed about the progress. It's just a tiny bit but has big impact: I know that it's running, I know the progress and I can expect when it finishes and I feel staying in control. Here's the tiny screenshot that makes me happy:<img alt="" src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/vietlq/IhPJshsmwPSsbFzGQkFgDfVQd4wTvfp1kbbOBhu7S0NwEitkB0YoCAgHwoMa/pastedGraphic.tiff.converted.jpg" width="331" height="108" /></p>
<p>I deduce that good design and good application cares about keeping users informed, making them feel staying in control and reduces the degree of uncertainties.</p>
