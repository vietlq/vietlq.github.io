<p>My MacBook was shipped with Tiger and then I upgraded to Leopard. Both of them were too fat: 15GB or more.</p>
<p>The default set up installs all printer drivers and languages as they don't know my (and yours too) specific needs. So I ended up wasting space for those languages that I wish I knew. This time, when I put in my install DVD, I removed all languages and drivers (English is the default so you can't remove). Surprisingly, it took me only 6.1GB to do full installation, instead of 15GB+ (I saved ~9GB man)! If you have DVD with you, plug it in, navigate to Optional Installs, run it and un-check those unnecessary languages and printer drivers. And you are done, your Leopard now is very slim.</p>
