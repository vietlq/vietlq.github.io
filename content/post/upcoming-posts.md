I realised planning and making a wishlist would make me more productive and more focused. Hence, I decided to schedule time to write the following topics (not in any particular order):

1. How to decode Ethereum UTC JSON files to extract private key
2. Using SFINAE to check if a C++ class/structure implement a method
3. Working with Hugo quirks and creating semi-automated posting
4. C++ mix-ins for fun and profit
5. Deriving Ethereum keys
6. Manually sign and verify Ethereum messages
7. Writing a JSON parser in OCaml
8. Implementing a simple version of std::tuple
