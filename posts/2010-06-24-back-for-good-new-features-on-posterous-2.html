<div class="posterous_autopost">
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Was not using this blog for quite a while as it lacked the features I needed such as reordering of the images in a gallery. Today I got an email from Posterous announcing a bundle of new features such as updated web editor, more flexible image&#47;photo management and 2 new themes.</p>
<p>I love the new theme named "Minimal" (currently in use). It's clean &amp; elegant. There are a few important additions to the themes, such as show on click and show on hover widgets. JS is not yet allowed but let's hope that there are will be more dynamic widgets to compensate the designers and users.</p>

<p>I'm waiting for the moment when designers can add their own JS snippets. The meta language by Posterous for theme design is not feature rich yet. The editor always lacks the "justified" text alignment feature. Let's wait for a surprise from them.</p>
